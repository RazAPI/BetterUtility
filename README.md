# Functions
## hook
```lua
hook(game.ReplicatedStorage.REMOTEAREA, function(args)
    if typeof(args) ~= "table" then
        for i, v in pairs(args) do
            print(i .. " | " .. v)
        end
    else
        print(args .. " (typeof=" .. typeof(args) .. ")")    
    end
end)
```
should be obvious

```

```

```

### Other not important functions
time() -- Get Current Time<br>test() -- Like a UNC test, but your checking if your functions are up-to-date, only checks the BIG functions not the "not important" functions.<br>UnloadUtility() -- unload for testing (should only be used in Dev environments)
### Logs and allat
Utility has LOG SUPPORT ðŸŽ‰<br>
Logs are automatically enabled, go ahead check them:
```lua
for i = 1, #_G.UtilityStorage do
    print(_G.UtilityStorage[i])
end
```
# Troubleshooting
check remotes, etc. make sure no errors in console from your functions. else contact _xpluv
## other concerns

# Can I use Source.
Yes, just don't distribute it. Or I will personally obfuscate this script and block you from using it.
